0,KENNETH SCRUGGS,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,0,2018-08-07,1.0,I PURCHASED ONE AT BIG LOTS FOR $5 THAT SOUNDED BETTER,54
1,Robert Altman,Nice inexpensive unt,1,2018-08-06,4.0,"Purchased this sound bar for my camper because it is hard to here the tv when the A/C is on. I hooked it up this weekend sounds good does not deliver a lot of base. The tv is hard wired into the sound bar, I paired my iphne and I pad to stream music. Both devices paired up with out a proablem. The remote that comes with it did not work I can only turn the sound bar off and on the other buttons vol up and down, and the mode buttons don’t do anything. I wish I could get another remote that works. Other then that it does what I brought it for.",546
2,Joel Clarke,DONT BOTHER....TRASH,0,2018-08-03,1.0,I’ve had this thing for less than a day and im packing it back up to send it back. This trash product worked to 5mins and hasn’t worked since...doesn’t matter if aux or bluetooth its TRASH so it doesn’t workz,208
3,tammie walker,Really made a difference while it lasted,0,2018-08-02,2.0,Received next day :) hooked it up and it worked great for awhile. ...then the controller stopped working and it kept going into some ear phone mode after about 30 minutes of that the volume cut off  I wrote the seller hoping they can help!,239
4,Neruda,"Small, light, loud with multi-functionality",0,2018-08-02,5.0,"This little soundbar puts out quite a lot of volume. It comes with all of the cables one would need. It was easy to get my TV to recognize it via Bluetooth connection. It has a small footprint that I like for my bedroom. The TV in there is less massive than the one in the livingroom. I didn't need a super long soundbar to use with that TV. This fit the bill perfectly. This unit pushes out bass frequencies pretty well, too. I was surprised by that.",451
5,zombiemasteruno,Soundbar constantly goes into sleep mode.,0,2018-08-01,1.0,"The soundbar had great sound, but I REALLY dislike the sleep mode. The description says that it is only supposed to go into sleep mode when not in use. We have tried to watch many programs and movies only to find that this soundbar CONSTANTLY goes into sleep mode. I'm returning this item to try and find one that will not do this.",331
6,Anonymous,"I like it, then only thing is",0,2018-07-30,4.0,"Works very well.  I like it, then only thing is, when you are using it, it automatically turns off pretty quickly.  Can't watch a full movie without it turning off twice.  Also, when you turn it on at first, it is so loud notifying it's connected.  Just seems like two unnecessary issues.",288
7,Dawn Robinson,Apparently not for TV use :(,0,2018-07-28,2.0,"Great little speaker but doesn't actually work with my tv, which is what I bought it for. :/",92
8,funlovin,It's a completely useless waste of money,1,2018-07-27,1.0,"I was going to use this speaker for my business, but it's so called ""features"" make that impossible. It turns off by itself every two hours which I can't stop it from doing. When I turn it back on it YELLS out that its connecting, and if the battery is low, be prepared for it to yell at you loudly through the speaker until you stop what you're doing and plug it in. It's a completely useless waste of money.",409
9,Rachel Moore,Ok Sound but Remote arrived broken,0,2018-07-26,4.0,Product was easy to setup & sound is great. Only issue I have is remote doesn’t work very well & has a piece broken off the top of it. Not worth sending back but remote was the main reason I bought this unit.,208
10,Amazon Customer,Bluetooth worked....tv audio did not work.,1,2018-07-24,3.0,"I bought this to improve the sound quality of my new 55"" tv. Once plugged in i adjusted all settings needed. No sound at all. I tried the bluetooth to my phone to confim the device wasn't malfunctioning. Bluetooth worked fine.
I called my tv manufactuer. They pretty much said ""other"" sound bars dont work with my tv. They prefer I buy their brand. Whatever.
The main purpose i needed a sound bar was for my tv. So i decided to return it for not working for what i needed. 3 stars for working properly with bluetooth though. Pandora sounded really decent on it. I just dont have a need for a soundbar anywhere else.
I would have kept it had it worked for my tv based on what it sounded like with Bluetooth.
Thank you amazon for making the return process easy.",759
11,wireless customer,Not worth it,0,2018-07-24,1.0,Horrible. Not even as loud as my tv and distortion everywhere. Surprised at how much it costs and how much it sucks.,116
12,nathan gill,maybe it's a lemon. maybe it's just crap.,0,2018-07-24,1.0,holy crap. not even half the volume of the tv i plugged it into. haven't tried it yet on anything else... but that's because i didn't buy it for anything else. probably gonna return it. haven't decided yet.,206

15,ShaySing,I can hear the TV now,1,2018-07-19,4.0,"Purchased for my front room because the TV (TCL Roku) volume is really low even when turned up to max so I wanted something to hear over the kids, I would say this increased the TVs volume by at least 50% so I'm pretty happy with it. If you want something that will rattle your house, look elsewhere.",300
16,Roopa Kumari,Super Sound Bar,0,2018-07-18,5.0,"I had bought this Bluetooth Sound bar for listening music indoor as well as outdoor. Sound Quality is exceptional, loud enough and clear, can feel bass surround effect. It comes with all necessary accessories connectors to connect to various types of devices such as TV, Phone, MP3 Player and the best of all is, supports Memory Card & USB Storage devices as well. It come with nice small remote too. The size of this is compact. Great product for the price. I recommend this!!",477
17,Hope,Not for your tv,0,2018-07-17,2.0,Will not work with a tv. Can only use with cell phone.,54
18,Dominic Lillian,Pretty good product,0,2018-07-16,4.0,"Pretty good product, and performs well for the price. One thing that makes absolutely no sense about it, however, is that you cannot turn the device on with the remote unless the dial has been switched over to the ""on"" position. Adding to this, you cannot turn the volume up past wherever the dial is set when using the remote. Completely nonsensical design choice. Other than that, it's plenty loud when I need it to be and the sound quality is decent.",453
19,SuperAwesomeDawson,Neat sound bar definitely exceeds my expectations!,7,2018-07-13,5.0,"This really is an excellent product. I'm using it right now to verbally dictate this review. It has very clear sound and has very nice volume too. It is definitely worth the price. It will connect to my TV, and then I can quick disconnect from my television and connect it to my phone for phone calls or to my laptop for video games. It is an excellent product!",361
20,Colby R.B.,but the sound quality is awesome. Even my kids were impressed,6,2018-07-11,5.0,"Bought this to go in our kitchen to play background music and I think I will use it every where now. It is small in size, but the sound quality is awesome. Even my kids were impressed. I recommend this.",202
21,paulsteam,really great sound for it's size,0,2018-06-27,5.0,"this is excellent movie/tv quality sound that is perfect for a smaller dwelling - moved from house to townhouse and decided not to irritate the neighbors :) had this for well over a year, excellent sound and super easy to hookup (literally just 1 plug into the tv and done)",273
22,Steve Dom,One Star,0,2018-04-12,1.0,Stopped working after 1 year. Junk!,35
23,mary Dupuis,Five Stars,0,2018-01-20,5.0,Great sounding bar. Love it,27
24,Mike D,Overall sound is muffled and there is no equilizer control to improve.,0,2018-01-18,2.0,"I was hoping for a much better overall sound by going from the TV speakers to the Yamaha soundbar.  After installing it into the system, I was underwhelmed with the sound quality and especially the mids and highs.  It seems to be a muffled sound. There is also no way to equalize the sound on the bar to enhance the mids an high bands which surprised me.  It also doesn't seem to deliver a crisp low frequency so maybe the recertification done on this returned item at the factory may have missed a chronic problem.
I may compare by going back to the TV speakers and see which works better but after using it for 6 months, I would not give this soundbar a favorable recommendation.",681
25,Raging Stallion,"Clear rich sound, solid base",2,2017-12-18,5.0,"I was having some issues with my T.V. speakers and thought if I bought a sound bar and turn the t.v. speakers all the way down, it would fix my issue.  It didn't work so I ended up buying a new T.V. as well.  But I'm still so glad that I bought this sound bar because it does not disappoint  I think I only paid about $50 for this refurbished Yamaha sound bar about a year ago and it works perfectly to this day!  I always get an uneasy feeling when purchasing anything with that dreadful ""refurbished"" word in the title, but I have to say, this is one of my best buys of the year.  The sound is rich and the base is perfect for my setup.  BUT - if you think you're going to use this sound bar for college keg parties all night long with the volume cranked up, then you're sadly mistaken.  This is just a MAJOR upgrade from any stock T.V. speakers and has great sound for what it is.  Don't get me wrong, it can definitely be turned up during movie night to deliver some powerful sound, I just wouldn't recommend it for rave parties.  I live in a small apartment and this speaker is perfect for delivering quality clear sound without shaking the complex.  It looks very sleek and attractive stretched out across my entertainment center shelf just below my television.  Installation is a breeze- you simply plug it into your t.v. and you're done.  The remote is small and basic but I honestly don't think it needs to be anything other than what it is.  I'm giving this speaker 5 stars based on the quality of sound it gives me for my setup and the price point of which it costs.  It also has bluetooth which is a major bonus.  It's very easy to connect my iphone or echo so I can listen to my music during the holidays or any other occasion.  There's no need to make any changes if you want to watch a DVD or connect your game console, it will automatically work just as long as you are using your T.V.  The only time you have to make a change is if you connect your bluetooth, in which case, you have to push one button and then you're set.  If you want good sound at a great price, then you should definitely give this product a try.  I would ABSOLUTELY buy this again and highly recommend it.",2194

27,Amazon Customer,Best speaker for the best price!,0,2017-10-31,5.0,"Excellent sound quality from a sleek looking single bar speaker. Looks great on the mantle under the tv.

28,Nathan White,looks and functions like a brand new unit,0,2017-10-12,5.0,"included what appears to be all original packaging as well.  simple soundbar for our master bedroom near the kid's room, no separate sub actually a bonus in our case.  looks and functions like a brand new unit.",210
29,TeamCanote,"Use it for Piano, Tv, and Music!",1,2017-10-10,5.0,"My wife forced me to give up my old surround sound system when we bought our new house because there wasn't really a place for its outdated size and because the wires were driving her crazy. I knew I would be taking a hit going from a surround sound experience to a sound bar, but because of the way I have it set up, I have not missed it one bit. I have always respected the Yamaha brand especially when it comes to sound, and so when I saw that they had a sound bar in my price range even though it was recertified, I jumped at it. I have still yet to be disappointed with them. The sound is superb! The bass is pretty good as well. Nothing to my surround sound subwoofer, but still pretty good to say the least. I'm perfectly happy to play my music on it as well as listen to an action packed movie. In the pictures attached, you can see the way I have it set up really supplements a surround sound feel. My 4K TV has great speakers and so both sounds complement each other. I also use this sound bar as the speakers for my Yamaha CP 33 piano, and it sounds beautiful. The Yamaha app for this sound bar is great to have as well. It has a few extra features that are only on there. On a side note, it is really nice that the remote allows the lights to be turned off or dimmed. I did not know it had this feature. Also it has an option for your sound bar to 'learn' the volume controls of your TV remote so that only one remote is needed to turn both up at the same time. Takes some playing around with, but its pretty useful. All and all, I am extremely happy with it. However, there was one big mess up. They sent me instructions, a remote, and cords for a similar but completely different sound bar. Which confused the living daylights out of me! I finally had it sorted out by looking up the correct manual online. I then contacted them and had them send me the correct ones. This was a huge hassle, but they corrected it without blinking an eye so just make sure the model numbers correspond to your particular sound bar in the instructions.",2048

54,RICK,On waste your money.,0,2017-05-24,1.0,Disappointed in sound quality.  When laying flat the speakers point to the ceiling so it's hard to hear unless cranked up.

64,snowleopard,Good For the Price,19,2017-05-08,4.0,"I'm going to be a little critical in this review, so let me state right up front for the cost, this is a very good sound bar, and worth the money, if it fits your needs.
I purchased this unit almost on accident, looking to order a more robust unit, but gave it a go anyway. Here are some key things to know.
•  The unit was super simple to install, and get going. I only glanced at the instructions. The remote is also easy to figure out. The app downloaded fine on my iPhone, and was a little more complicated, but worked as well.
• This is not the same as a full surround system. Not even close. Even it's ""extreme"" surround feature is just a little more stereo imagery than regular ""stereo"" setting. If you want full surround, buy a surround system.
• The bass on this system is okay. Not closed to a subwoofer at all, but not thin either. Just average I'd say. But for being just a bar, that's not bad.
• The Clear Voice feature is slightly noticeable. After all the stellar reviews on it, perhaps my expectations were too high.
• I own a Sony Brava top of the line TV from a couple years back with good stereo speakers built in. I was expecting this sound bar to be significantly better after all the reviews on how this blows away TV speakers, but it was not. It was only slightly better.  If you own an average TV, this bar will probably be a noticeable improvement. On a TV with high quality speakers, probably not. Go for something bigger.
• The volume on this bar was able to get louder than my Sony TV. But I have a fairly small living room, where that wasn't necessary most of the time.
All in all, I'd say for the money this is a good buy if you just need a decent bar. However, if you are like me and looking for a really good sound system, you're going to need a higher end bar, plus a sub woofer, or a full surround system.",1839
65,Forestdog,Highly recommend!,0,2017-05-06,5.0,"We have only had it one day, but this sound bar is totally awesome! Great volume, great deep tones. I am thrilled that it has the 3.5 millimeter, the coax, and optical jacks. My family highly recommends it for other customers.",226

77,redtwo3283,Great value,1,2017-04-19,4.0,"Good sound quality and excellent value for the price. I changed to this sound bar after using a full 5.1 surround sound system with a dedicated A/V receiver, mainly for convienence. I moved, and didn't want to go through the process of wiring my old speakers around my room and having them so visible. And I was past the point in my life of needing to crank the sound up to 11 all the time. For the majority of TV watching, this is perfect, and better than any speakers built into your TV.
The bluetooth is a nice feature, and I do use it to play music off my phone when friends are over and whatnot. The sound and power functions also programmed fine to my cable remote, and it has an app you can download for most of the dedicated remote's functions. Between the two, I almost never have to touch the soundbar's remote.
I wish the bass was better - even pushing the bass setting up it's not going to be thumping - but you can add a subwoofer down the road if you desire. This does not recreate a true surround sound system, but you shouldn't expect it to. If you are a major audiophile, get a full 5 or 7 speaker system. If you want sound that's better than your TV with something that won't take up a ton of space and look nice in your living room setup, go for it.",1268

84,Penny,Very poor refurb from a good name company like Yamaha.,1,2017-04-13,2.0,"I was disappointed with this sound bar because when the input was off it sits there humming and never turns itself off automatically.  I also was unhappy with the lack of bass even with the bass boost it was lacking.  Since it came with no remote I couldn't easily make adjustments to it.  I would recommend staying away from this unit because unlike other factory refurbished items that are hard to tell them from new this one doesn't include the remote, cables, instructions, wall template or anything... just the bare sound bar.  Yamaha either cheaped out or the refurb is not a true factory one.  It has made me re-think of what I used to consider a high-end sound company like Bose now to a low end one like Vizio.  Even a Vizio sound bar would have surpassed this refurb model in sound and quality.",804
85,James H.,"The sound quality is good, but not great",1,2017-04-11,4.0,"The system works as described and does what it is supposed to do fairly well. The sound quality is good, but not great. Regardless, for the price, you won't find a better deal. I have a small apartment, so this unit was perfect for me as the sound does fill the room. The bass is good, voices are clear and it does well on a full range of audio. However, if you are looking for theater quality sound I would suggest you look elsewhere and expect to pay a lot more money. If you aren't a audio geek, and you just enjoy good sound, I would definitely recommend this system.",571

In some angles it doesn't pick up remote signal while the TV works fine. It is annoying when it doesn't turn on/off along with the TV.

Sound is great and hookup was extremely easy but remember to mute your TV or it won't work. Great and clear instructions in owner's manual. Surround sound is very good especially considering it's from a bar in front of you. A full blown 5 speaker sound system it's not but it does give you a full sound that really enhances action movies.

When I looked for a replacement I found that other people had reported it playing out after only a few months, which mine had done.  They're not sold anymore so I opted for this and I'm very pleased.  It comes with everything to set it up and the phone app is a nice feature.  It's shorter than the Panasonic which is good because the Panasonic blocked the TV controller IR port, even though it's a Panasonic TV, so I don't have to hold the remote over my head to turn the TV off anymore.

With the sound on medium volume and the subwoofers cranked up, (thanks to the hubby), I almost had a wind tunnel movie style effect of being blasted against the wall - and I was just watching the opening credits for Game of Thrones! This soundbar really does deliver a surround sound feel to everything that you're watching, and music sounds much fuller and richer. I know a lot of people don't like the lack of volume indicator, (like my hubby), but I love that the lights are on the top towards the tv so that I'm not looking at lights the whole time and I have no problem looking at the lights that flash in an amount of how high the sound is, I think that's pretty creative actually. I'm normally the tech support for our household as my husband will smash any technology that disagrees with him, but my hubby set this up all by himself and he even read the manual, (I have the pictures to prove it but he won't let me post them).

Without the subwoofer,  the soundbar handled very good all tunes and movies way much better than my TV speakers and also my Altec Lansing 2.1 that it's replacing. The Bluetooth range is excellent,  the soundbar is well designed and it does sound way much better if it placed upright rather than laying flat in a table.

I was watching some videos thru Amazon and on one program, everything was fine. But on another program, I heard the intro/theme music but then absolutely no sound after that. Now, to be fair, this is using the Amazon app on my PS3, going thru the receiver, to the TV and then optical digital cable to the soundbar. But again, it is just weird that one program worked fine but another didn't. So...is it the program (The Grand Tour, episodes 6 & 7)? Or the PS3 app? Or something else? I don't know. But aside from The Grand Tour so far, it seems to be working fine. Watched a movie and an episode of a different TV program and both were fine. Will continue to investigate for now.",937

At first, I thought the refurbished soundbar was dead on arrival, but it turns out the included batteries for the remote were dead, which is odd, because I don't think I've ever received included batteries that were just completely dead before for any other purchase I've made, but that was a simple fix as I have lots of AAAs lying around (my old Vizio uses the same batteries, and those batteries are still going strong after 4 years).
And, unlike some soundbars (*cough*my old vizio*cough*), this one also has physical buttons on the soundbar itself in case you lose your remote or have no batteries (that's how I realized the included batteries were dead).
It looks brand new with all the annoying clear decals to peel off and everything.
As long as there isn't some known defect that's going to cause this thing to self destruct within a year, this is a huge steal at its current price.",1163

We have this set up in our living room which isn't huge but decent size and the sound is amazing. The bass on it is great, I wasn't sure what to expect with just one bar but it covers space well! My favorite part is the sound clarity. With kids watching action movies or scary movies there are always the loud part when all you hear is the noise and have to turn it way up just to hear the voices. This makes a huge difference and you can hear the voices so so much better! I will highly recommend and if I ever get another sound bar this will be it!!!",661

After a lot of researching all of the various sound bars out there, we decided to give this one a chance because of all the excellent reviews - and knowing the Yamaha brand.  We were a little nervous because of the low price and ""factory recertified"" label, but it looks brand new and works perfectly.  My husband worked for a large company in the entertainment industry for 25 years, and has a professional ear.  He described the sound as ""full, crisp and sharp"" with excellent bass without a separate sub-woofer.  It was super easy to set up with our cable TV, and connecting to Bluetooth so we could listen to our iTunes was a snap.  After playing with the settings a bit, both music (in stereo mode) and TV (in surround sound mode) sound great.  Perfect for our small 1200 sf vacation place, especially since we don't want to bother our neighbors with too much boomy base (if that's what you're looking for, you would probably want something with a separate subwoofer).",997

203,Ashley Sue Bullers,One of the best purchases we made this year.,1,2016-10-18,5.0,"I pretty much despise the thought of owning something refurbished, or ""recertified"" as Yamaha calls this, but my husband has been searching for a soundbar for a couple years.  He really wanted to spend only about $100 or $120, but most of the bars in that range (new) are, well, lacking.  Enter Amazon Prime Day this July... I hunted, and this bar was dropped in price, and the new version has pretty great ratings (without us jumping into the three hundred dollar range, which we just weren't willing to do).  It was still higher than he had been looking, but I figured it was worth a gamble and still comes with a 1-yr warranty.
We've had it now for several months and use it every day. It makes a WORLD of difference compared to the built-in speakers on our LG flat screen.  Twice, I accidentally had it (the Yamaha sound bar) turned up so loud that when I turned on the TV or whatever, I thought I actually damaged the speakers in it (which would break my heart), but nope - it's been working great.  Besides, no speakers should even have the ABILITY to be turned up so loudly that it could damage them.  Make them top out where they can still handle it.  Wtfrick.
Anyhow, it's not surround sound, but it's as close as we can imagine getting without stringing speakers up all over our living area.  It provides a lot of depth of sound and enhances so much of what we watch.  We play a lot of movies on Netflix and Firestick, and it all sounds SO good.  Just play around with the settings (clear voice, subwoofer, etc) to get it where you want it.
The only issue we had so far was a couple weeks ago, I played something on our Sony BD/DVD player - which I had not yet done (with streaming, I guess most of us aren't using discs often anymore).  It was a Blu-Ray Disc.  And the sound was a MESS.  The voices were low, the music was BOOMING... and this is for the movie ""Love Actually""!  I shudder to think how it would have sounded if I put in an action thriller with explosions!  I spent the nearly two hours holding the remote, quick on the gun to hit volume up and volume down so my mother-in-law would not go deaf but would still hear the characters!  It was distracting to us both, and particularly to me who had to play ""AV Geek"" for the movie.
After the debaucle of that sound on the BD, I Googled it and saw this is common - and one suggestion was to go into your TV settings and BD/DVD player settings, and adjust the sound settings for it, as they are probably still set to play through the TV, meaning that it will distort and play improperly through your soundbar!  A-HA!  Indeed, the settings were set for TV, so I made some adjustments to the settings for BD/DVD playback audio.  However, I have yet to play another disc yet to see if that fixes the problem.  Maybe now that I'm thinking about it, I'll do that this weekend and update this review.
All in all, so far, so good.  This has been a purchase we've been pleased with.  We simply enjoy our viewing experience now, as opposed to being constantly aware of the sound (because it was so poor through the TV before buying a soundbar).  NOT thinking about something being good is GREAT in comparison to constantly thinking about how not good something else is! :)",3232

229,KirkDK,Excellent Value - Powerful when combined with a powered subwoofer,3,2016-08-18,4.0,The price for this sound bar was fantastic.  The value was outstanding.  By attaching this sound bar to a powered subwoofer - it allowed me to replace a receiver and 5 speakers and all the cables and wires.  It was not a perfect match for the sound I had with the full system - but it was so good that I felt confident with the replacement.  The adding of the powered subwoofer really made the difference (the subwoofer I was using on the other system).  The surround effect is not that noticeable - but the overall sound quality is excellent.  Watching San Andreas or Godzilla we actually have to 'turn it down' and we like it loud!  Love the convenience of setting up my DirecTV and TV remote volume controls and power controls...I rarely pull out the actual Yamaha remote.  Now the sound bar is always on with the TV speakers disabled.  No need to power on a receiver and mess with inputs...,894

232,Beth S.,Yamaha has been doing quality sound longer than the other brands have been making TVs,5,2016-08-15,5.0,"This unit is super well designed.  When paired with a separate powered subwoofer it is all most will need for a home theater set-up.  The soundbar has a solid list of features and options available via included IR remote, but it really shows its strength once you connect it to your smartphone device.  Once connected to my IOS smartphone it allowed a larger selection of sound field options to tailor the experience to a wide variety of media including Movie, TV, Sports, Games, Music.  Each of the settings made substantial changes to the internal EQ helping the simple soundbar sound like it had some low powered satellite speakers working with it.  Although it is not likely to truly replace a 7.1 sound experience it is a solid starting point for those on budget, or honestly a reasonable option for those wanting to simplify a room with  less wires.  I attached a Sony 10"" powered subwoofer using the Sub Out to add a bit more low end thump.  The soundbar's included subwoofer is suitable for standard movie experience but most will likely agree that any soundbar truly needs a separate bass maker.  Yamaha makes quality stuff, and the smartphone app substantial steps this unit up beyond similar price point TV brand soundbars in the market.",1248
233,XD,Great Soundbar,1,2016-08-12,5.0,This soundbar surpassed my expectations. I bought it refurbished and during prime day and I can honestly say it's worth it and much more. It came as good as new and sounded as good as new.,188
234,J.P.,"Not a ""surround sound"" home theater experience but...",37,2016-08-11,5.0,"An excellent sound bar that is beautiful in design and produces better than expected sound. This doesn't come close to producing a cinematic quality sound and won't replace a good 2.1, 5.1, or 7.1 sound system but what it does do it does well.
So what does it do?
1. It beats the pants of any stock TV speakers.
2. The ""clear voice"" option allows for listening at lowered volumes and still clearly understanding every word. This is especially handy if you have a napping baby in the house.
3. It saves tons of space over most alternatives and can even be wall mounted!
4. It produces good sound for most music and general TV.
The downside?
1. It doesn't have thumping bass. This was not an issue for me but I know is for some.
2. Not really good for movies but is not that horrible either. In other words one might say if space or budget are issues then it meets minimal sound standards and will due but will not give you mind blowing sound.
3. Adds an additional remote to the mix that will only have some limited functionality with a universal remote.

253,Eric Peterson,A great complement for my new 4K TV,3,2016-07-15,5.0,"Extremely easy to setup.  Connecting the optical cable is trivial, but I was concerned about the difficult of getting the system working seamlessly with a single remote.
My TV (2016 LG 4K) allowed me to easily send audio through the sound bar only, and the Yamaha manual made it very easy to set the power, mute and volume buttons so that it turns on when my TV is turned on and turns off when my TV is turned off.
Bluetooth is also easy to set up, and while I'll likely never use it, Yamaha's HG Controller app in the iPhone app store allows me to control sound bar from my phone with that app.
The speakers sound great out of the box, and while the sound bar offer the ability to tweak the bass levels, I see no reason to.  At the volumes my family watches TV and listens to music at, I see no reason to use an external subwoofer, although that option exists.
I'm no audiophile, and I did buy this, refurbished, as a Prime Day deal, but while the box looks very worn, everything inside the box looks new and works great.",1022

Sound is deep, voice clear function really cleans up hard to hear voices (and vocals on music too).
Music stand alone on Bluetooth from my iPhone from PandoraOne sound fantastic.
Over all very happy.  I am using this with a bedroom TV set up, not in a large living room or family room.  I am picky about sound.  This obviously is not a $3500 plus speaker system, which I can fully appreciate and hear the difference of high end quality speakers but they are simply out of budget, but this is a very pleasing affordable answer and I am not disappointed in anyway with my purchase, granted it was at a very good price.",842

I have a Visio sound bar in my basement and wish I would have stayed with what I already knew. Yamaha use to be a great brand not sure what happened with this model. Maybe it's a starter sound bar and got caught up in the price. I would not buy this product again!!

Do not get discouraged by the word ""refurbished"".  This machines new looks absolutely new.  For the steep discount it's worth it.",433
