1,Holly A. Hall,Love them,0,2018-08-07,4.0,Smooth going on. Bright pigments like them so much I'm ordering the 72 set. Was weary because I had major problems with the watercolor set and got no response,158
2,missann,Good value,0,2018-08-06,5.0,Good quality for price blends okay good color selection too,59
3,Kaye Hartzler,Wonderful pencils. I have not had the lead break ...,0,2018-08-01,5.0,Wonderful pencils.  I have not had the lead break inside the pencil yet.  Love this.,84
4,i breathe air,"Inexpensive, super pigmented, and easy to work with",1,2018-07-31,5.0,"Inexpensive, super pigmented, and easy to work with! I draw traditionally, with pencils, pens, and paper being my main medium. I was looking for a good set of inexpensive pencils, and through various recommendations and videos on YouTube, I decided on Arteza. Not disappointed one bit. :) Absolutely love them.",310
5,CMJ,"Great pencil to start with or add to collection, great value",0,2018-07-29,5.0,I like the great variety in colors available. I found these to sharpen easily and hold their point well.  I used  My hand held sharpener and also tested with an electric one. Both sharpened the pencils nicely. I had no problems with breakage at any time.  The color laid down evenly and also blended and shaded nicely.  This is a great pencil for any student or hobby artist. I have many other name brands and types of pencils in my collection.  One of the nicest wax base pencils in this price range.  The tin makes it nice to protect the pencils when not using them.,568
6,Leland C,Very high quality set.,0,2018-07-21,5.0,"Since I got my daughter the sketching pencil set, she needed some color to fill in her drawings.  This set is awesome.  It's got good range of tones without getting to granular in the range of shades.  The tin container with 2 trays is a perfect way to lay them out and pick out the best color.  Also each color and pencil number is labeled for better reference.  The trays keep the set organized and protected.  Very high quality set.",435
7,Mr Bryan,Buena calidad. Falta probarlos,1,2018-07-20,5.0,Muy lindos,10
8,Jennifer W.,Nice feel and best colored pencils,0,2018-07-19,5.0,Awesome colored pencils that glide smoothly for any artist,58
9,Aileen,Nice,1,2018-07-14,4.0,They are good--better than those cheaper brands. I like the range in colors. They go smoothly on paper and are vibrant. They work well for someone who colors recreationally.,173
10,Neraul Terrab,Average,1,2018-07-07,1.0,"Absolutely disappointing! I was robbed a color as Coyote(A111) was duplicated, these pencils lack color intensity/vibrancy not as buttery as the crayola artist blend. I can't complain about the pricing as it is more affordable than other artist quality brands and they are not as waxy as Prisma color.",301
11,Cathy Ahloy,Color Pencils,1,2018-06-26,4.0,"Not as a smooth as Prisma Color pencils. They don‚Äôt blend as well but, good.",76
12,Esmeralda,All the colors are available,2,2018-06-24,5.0,I love these colors!!,21
13,John S Sebis II,A most buy!,3,2018-06-22,5.0,"These pencils are WELL worth the money! They're a harder pencil, but they blend amazingly. I've found they work best on CreateSpace paper, and they won't leave those white spots behind! The books I feel they were made for were the Hannah Lynn books! OMG! I don't think I'll ever use another pencil in those books again. (Picture included does have White Acrylic Paint, Black Roller Ball Pen, and Black Acrylic Paint used in it. All pencil work though is with the Arteza 48 set!)",478
14,Shane O. Laake,"Not as soft as Prismacolor, but still quite good for the price",1,2018-06-20,5.0,"While I've loved using Prismacolor in the past, this is a worthy competitor offering almost the same quality at a better price.  The color selection is great, and the included tin is a nice touch.  The pencils themselves are well made, deliver the color to the page well, and refrain from breaking.  They lack the softer more blendable composition of the Prismacolor pencils.
In the end I'd say the Prismacolor is better, but that difference may or may not matter based on your technique and preferences.  For the price, these are a great place for most people to start.",570
15,The Modernist Medium,Great quality at a great price.,0,2018-06-19,5.0,"I've been using Prismacolor pencils since college because frankly there wasn't anything comparable in quality. Until now that is. These Arteza colored pencils really are VERY good!!!!! They don't break easily while using or crumble when sharpening. The lead is hard but not waxy so color is a bit thin, so it may take a few passes to get the depth of color you want. This box holds 48 assorted colored pencils. The colors are true, not muddy. I have used these on paper, cardstock, ceramic/pottery, canvas and etched metal and they work just as well as pricier pencils.  In the past I have tried cheaper pencils but they were really just child coloring book quality.  They are far superior to other ""inexpensive"" colored pencils on the market. I highly recommend them both for quality and price. These Arteza pencils are $16.99 compared to $28 for a 48 set kit of Prismacolor.  For the price they are a GREAT addition to any artist or budding artist supplies.",959
16,SnowedUnder,Nice quality for a budget price.,2,2018-06-18,4.0,"This colored pencil set from Arteza is nice quality for a budget price. The set of 48 covers a wonderful array of colors and comes nicely packaged in a tin. The pencils come pre-sharpened, although they are flat-topped instead of sharpened to a point - like I would prefer.
I have been using Prismacolor pencils for a long time and love that they are soft and can be easily blended. The Arteza set has nice rich color that is easily applied to paper but the lead is not as soft, making for a much scratchier mark, and are not as blendable. It's not necessarily a bad thing, it depends on what you are looking for in this medium. I myself prefer Prismacolor but this Arteza set is also a great choice, especially for the price.
As a side note: Older sets of Prismacolor were made in USA and I have read that they are now manufacturing in Mexico. This Arteza set states that it is made in PRC (or China) in small letters on the back of the tin.",942
17,Roland Metivier,"Vivid, strong, and colorful",2,2018-06-15,5.0,Has a vivid and colorful gamut while being hard and sturdy. Would recommend.,76

22,Deborah Carver,Love these colored pencils,4,2018-05-25,5.0,"Love these colored pencils! When I started coloring choosing colors was hard I started with prisms color 24,about a week later I decided I needed more colors, I'm ready to move on to the 72.  Being new to coloring these pencils are great the colors are bright, they glide across the page. I have not had any problems with breaking. And these are just as good as the prismacolor!",378
23,Alvin France,Five Stars,0,2018-05-19,5.0,Colors were vibrant and bold!,29
24,Linda Crowder,I agree with the You Tube reviews of these new colored pencils,11,2018-05-17,4.0,I bought these after seeing reviews on You Tube. I like using them for some coloring techniques. I would say they are in between the Prismacolor colored pencil for soft core lead and Marco Raffine pencils for true color. I am happy with their performance.,255

30,becky riggsham,one of my new favorites,5,2018-04-30,4.0,"I loved the variety of colors and they are brilliant,  they will blend. I personally don't like the flat top,
because I immediately had to sharpen some of them to a point. Other than that they are in my opinion one of the
best - cost , color density, smooth  application and blend-ability. I really am loving them!",314
31,Tristan,Five Stars,2,2018-04-30,5.0,Pretty nice set!  They blend beautifully,40

35,Dana,2 of the samw color,0,2018-04-10,4.0,"Pretty nice pencils, I find them relatively easy to blend with. My only complaint is I received 2 of the same color.",116
36,vinco,Good price and nice color selection!,1,2018-04-10,5.0,"I am not a professional artist. I purchased  a copy of How To Draw Almost Everyday and wanted something better than the broken crayons and Crayola colored pencils my sons used in school when they were younger. I appreciate all the different colors and have found that for the price, they were a good choice for me.
I do not know if they are actually professional quality, but  I am very happy with them.",403
37,Scritter,Very good pencils! Especially for the price!!!,10,2018-04-08,4.0,"I'm just now really getting familiar with how to choose and how to use coloured pencils. I'm no expert, But I know what I like!  I find these to be good; they even approach greatness considering the price point!  The colours are bright and the go down fairly smoothly.  They are only a very little bit scratchy.  They blend well and it takes very little pressure to get the page saturated with colour.  The 'leads', (for lack of a better term), don't crumble during use or sharpening.  All in all these have been an excellent investment.  I first found the Arteza brand here on Amazon and I have purchased several of their products.  I am happy with these pencils, my Woodless Soft Pencils, My Gel Pen Sets, Paper, Watercolours, Water brushes, and the refills for the gell pens.  If you are looking at trying a new medium with a minimal cash outlay or are choosing a gift you could do a lot worse than Arteza!",909
38,MarkABee,Love these,6,2018-04-04,5.0,"Don't you love all the pencils lined up, ready to use.  I almost hate to actually take them out!  But when you do, then you delight in the well made perfect colors.",164
39,JumpDivine,Way too many green shades.,1,2018-04-03,3.0,"The picture feels very misleading. The colors are not this variable and these are not at all great for trying to color mandalas. Nothing, for me, will ever beat prismacolor pencils, however these are a decent affordable alternative.",232

53,Strategos,"Nice pencils, but over-priced",22,2017-12-19,4.0,"As an amateur coloring book using, I like these pencils very much, as they are vastly superior to the other pencils I've used. They are softer and have very nice consistent color with smooth buttery texture. So if like me, you are just using these for coloring books, they are very nice compared with what you are going to find in your local drug store.
My wife however, is an artist, and it took around one minute to determine that these are overpriced compared with say, the Prismacolor pencils that sell for around two thirds the price. So while I like these colored pencils very much, I will just call them great, not great for the price.
If you can find them on sale for cheap, by all means grab them if you are an amateur colorist like myself. Artistes will want to buy something higher grade most likely unless they are using them just for practice.",856
54,Crestviewer,I love the big assortment of colors and the tin that ...,1,2017-12-15,4.0,My daughter is really enjoying these colored pencils. I love the big assortment of colors and the tin that they can easily be stored in.,136
55,Dr. DR,great colors,3,2017-12-05,5.0,"There is a wide range of vibrant colors.  My 13y.o. is very content using these and doesn't notice much difference between these and prismacolor, which is the last brand of colored pencils she was using.  The tin container is compact and great for storage.",256
56,Barbara ( Babs ) Hightower,Not a bad set.,3,2017-11-26,4.0,I really like these pencils I have been using other kinds but they tend to bend and break with not much effort.  I like the colors as they vary and the tin they come in is quite nice to have. For artist I think this would be a nice started set for them.  It has all the colors and a tin they each have their own spot.  The tin is sturdy and easy to pack up in a back pack or an artist bag.,389
57,ocmd,A perfect gift,2,2017-11-17,5.0,My eleven year old grandson is an aspiring artist and he never has enough art supplies. I think this set will be a perfect gift for him. This looks like a high quality set of pencils. There‚Äôs a large variety of colors and they come in a nice tin container for gift giving and storage. I‚Äôll pair this with a sketch book for Christmas. I know he‚Äôll be satisfied with these.,371
58,This Old Man,Nice set of colored pencils to draw with,1,2017-11-16,4.0,I got these pencils for my daughter. She loves to draw and the 48 colors in the box will get her started. Its a nice set of colored pencils and comes in a nice metal box to store them. The package mentions Expert but Im not sure what that means. All in all I think anyone who enjoys drawing or coloring will like these. It would also make a nice gift.,351
59,LOL,This is a really nice set of pencils and would make a good gift ...,1,2017-11-16,5.0,This is a really nice set of pencils and would make a good gift for anyone who likes to color.  There is a wide array of colors and I like that it comes in a sturdy box.  It makes it much easier if you are traveling with them.  The colors seem to go on smoothly and do not break easily.,286
60,Mainiac,Very nice pencils,5,2017-11-14,4.0,"There isn't much text on the Amazon page as I write this, so I'm unable to compare this as ""what I got"" vs ""what you might be expecting. About the only information on what to expect is that these are labeled ""expert"", and of course, that's ""not quite"". But they are very nice pencils.
They come in two trays of 24, arranged as sort of a bright palette on top and more muted shades on the bottom, though of course you can arrange them however you like.
On the back of the box, not pictured as I write this, it says:
""Professional grade artist quality colored pencils
Break resistant, soft and thick leads
Smooth color laydown for superior blending and shading
Unsurpassably lightfast and acid free quality pigments
Ideal for drawing, illustrating, and coloring""
Lightfast and acid free do make them high-quality pencils, so possibly ""expert"" is not such a misnomer.
The ""lead"" is smooth and just a touch waxy, and these are easy to work with.",941
61,Herschel Greenberg,A Worthy Competitor,61,2017-11-13,5.0,"These are surprisingly good color pencils. I did not expect much, since I have been using Prismacolor for a long time.  I own Prismacolor Premier (soft with heavy coloring) and Prismacolor Verithin (hard with thin coloring).  These Arteze color pencils are closer to the Verithins in terms of strength and marks on the page.  The pencils come sharpened, but I found it interesting that they were sharpened to a flat top rather than to a point. Either way, once they are fully sharpened, coloring is a breeze. My son liked them as well, and he noticed that they improved his coloring when compared to his generic color pencils. As a competitor to Prismacolor, they seem to hold their own compared to the Verithins.  I would recommend these pencils to any aspiring artist, especially if this is the first time buying higher end pencils.",834
62,Courtland J. Carpenter,Good set of sketch pencils to start with especially if you like to express yourself with many many colors.,11,2017-11-12,4.0,"I've had some minor training in storyboarding for video game development, but I'm not a professional artist, so I don't know if these are ""expert"" grade or not.  It's nice having such an array of colors and shades, plus not having to initially sharpen the whole lot is a bonus because otherwise, I would not have been able to experiment with the colors (I would have left a lot unsharpened).  The lead hardness for me is perfect because I tend to press down more when I draw.  These would work exceptionally well for storyboarding as they do not require a perfect fill-in shading and you can make emphasis with the darker colors for perspective and then partially fill in the details without making it a painting.
I nice box to keep them in, and maybe good for travel or for an artists bench, but I would have liked a round container with dividers that I could quickly get to the colors I want.  I couldn't find a price, but for someone who is not a professional, in art school or just a dabbling artist it seems these are affordable based on the smaller sets.  I last went to art stores when I was learning storyboards in Vancouver in the late 1990's and a set like this would have been nearly a hundred bucks in Canadian money.  Recommended for all those who draw, but the pros who already know what they like.",1312
63,dschr,Rainbow in a box,5,2017-11-11,5.0,"All of the colors of the rainbow and much more in this tidy, attractive art box. The colors are organized by hue making it very easy to find the perfect shade. The pencils themselves are of the highest quality. They‚Äôre easy to hold and are painted to match the lead color. Great for kids or perfect for a pro. I love to create art, these make it easier.",353
64,RETSmile,"Beautiful Array of Colors, Not Super Soft",6,2017-11-10,4.0,"I love the tin container this comes in and it holds the pencils in place very well.  I also love the variety of colors.  There is such a wide array of them and they are vibrant and true to the colors - not faded out once you use them  .Although these say they are expert, I wouldn't say they are comparable to the Prismacolor pencils.  These Arteza are labeled as soft but they are not so in the same way or extent that those are. The color comes off as more of a fine tip without much smudge.  I like these and the color variety and if you like a finer tip these might be preferable to you.",591
65,Susan Johnson,Lots of Colors,0,2017-11-10,4.0,I got these for my six year old grandson and he loved them. There is a nice variety of colors to pick from.  He was ready to graduate from crayons and this is an excellent product to do so. I wouldn't rate them expert but I think they are perfect for children. They were easy for him to use and he had a great time with them. I think they are a great product.,359
66,A. Koren,Very nice pencil set,1,2017-11-10,5.0,These pencils work very well.Very nice coloration  Easy to use in very small areas because the pencils sharpen easily and do not break. I'm looking forward to buying other shades from the same manufacturer.  Lovely rainbow of colors. Fun for coloring in zentangle designs.,272
67,Sotto voce,Nice Xmas gift for the family artist,1,2017-11-05,4.0,"I picked these up as a Xmas gift for my G-daughter. She's showing talent. This set of 48 pencils presents an excellent palate to mix, blend, and match colors. As art pencil quality goes, these are advertised as 'expert'. I'd rate them as mid-grade.
I like the set. I think my G-daughter will too",295
68,Quickbeam,"Lovely color palette, nice box, good for a child eager to draw, not high end pencils.",5,2017-11-04,4.0,"I love to sketch and draw with colored pencils, strictly as a hobby, no actual training or talent. My go to pencils are Tombows. These Artezas suffer by comparison, they are just not as responsive for shading or depth of line. They are pre-sharpened which is nice for a young budding artist....ready to go!
I‚Äôd characterize these as a good first set for an interested child ready to go beyond crayons. Instead of spending a fortune on art supplies ( easy to do), this is a low cost way to see if your child has any sustained interest. You can always invest in higher end pencils later. I really love the strong color assortment of this set. If you are looking for colored pencils to noodle around with, these will certainly do. Shop for price; I see these heavily discounted at a variety of stores.",798
