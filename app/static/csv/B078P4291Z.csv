1,VRougeux,Weird Product,0,2018-08-12,2.0,"This product arrived quickly and packaged nicely.  My son installed it for me.  It has nice sound and I like it well enough; however, I find that every time I change the channel on my cable remote it interacts with the soundbar.  Every time I scroll through the channel guide with my cable remote the sound on the soundbar raises to unbelievable levels.  It's just weird and annoying.  I gave this product a 2 because I do like the sound, but it's just weird.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",495
2,Braedon Wilson,Decent sound bar but too few features,0,2018-08-09,2.0,The sound bar is decent for the price but has very little features. The real problem with it is it has zero customization features. I wish you could control individual sounds like bass or treble but I didn’t expect much for the price I paid. Another issue I have is not being able to tell what volume I’m on. It’s frustrating trying to find the right volume. Then the inconsistency of the volume is frustrating. Sometimes I won’t be able to hear a thing and then a commercial comes on and wakes up the whole neighborhood. Only reason it gets 2 stars is for the price and the simple fact that it produces sound.,610
3,Laura Sanchez,Nice Sound for a low budget sound bar,0,2018-08-08,4.0,"Dont spect to much and you will find a good sound bar in this product, No HDMI port so you only have the optical, RCA, AUX or Bluetooth.
The bass sounds very good even though it doesnt have a woofer",198
4,Amazon Customer,Excellent soundbar!,0,2018-08-07,5.0,Amazing sound and volume levels!,32
5,Anonymous,Great sound. Not too big not too small. Just right,0,2018-08-07,5.0,Wow I’m very amazed by this sound bar. Sounds amazing. Only flaw  found is the instructions are in several languages except English. But you don’t need instructions to connect it all you need is common sense. Sounds loud enough for a small apartment. Bass sounds great. FYI have triple A batteries ready for your remote.,320
6,Eric S,Perfect for a small room!,0,2018-08-07,4.0,I am using this as a wall mounted set of speakers under my PC monitor.  The sound is way better than the LCD monitors small speakers.  Rich sound - but certainly not booming bass.  It has enhanced my experience and not cost me a fortune.  Perfect for what I needed.,265
7,13usarmy,No instructions or bass. Decent sound.,0,2018-08-07,3.0,"Not much bass, which makes it sound kind of hollow, but better than the tv speakers. No installation instructions which made install way more complicated than it needed to be. Not worth returning but wouldn’t recommend it.",222
8,Justin,"Sounds good, for the price.",0,2018-08-07,5.0,"Very easy to setup. From out of the box, to listening to the T.V. playing through it, maybe 2 minutes.
 And for the price, the sound quality really surprised me. Good tone at any level. Yes I would recommend this unit, if you're not looking to break the bank, and still have a quality sound bar.",295
9,Amazon Customer,Will try again,0,2018-08-06,1.0,At first I really liked this product but when I tried to turn down the sound with the remote turned it up to the maximum level and wouldn’t turn off. I also turned it off and I could not turn it back on.  I’m going to see if I can return it and get a replacement. I already have the screws in the wall so I would like the same one.,331
10,Deana,Just what I needed,0,2018-08-05,4.0,"Great sound bar, real good sound",32
11,shoesRme,Keep packing box,0,2018-08-03,3.0,"I have tried to hook this to two different TVs, it not working on either one.  The only reason I haven’t sent it back is to much trouble",136
12,Michael Hazard,Did not boost my TV's volume,0,2018-08-01,2.0,I purchased this based on an Amazon customer review that indicated the item had resolved a volume issue (too low on some channels) they were experiencing.  I have the same problem but this sound bar did not help my issue at all.,228
13,cbkinnc,I like it. Plenty of sound,0,2018-07-31,4.0,"I like it. Plenty of sound, lots of ways to connect, perfect width for my needs and a pretty good pice. Kinda sounds a little hollow for my tastes but otherwise, its good",170
14,Alicia,Great purchase,0,2018-07-31,5.0,Love the sound. Love the Bluetooth capabilities.,48
15,A Reader,Does NOT Support Amazon TV,1,2018-07-31,1.0,"Because I had an electrician at my house doing other things, I had him install the Tao Tronics sound bar.  Seemed to work fine, but then, days later, I switched to Amazon TV (and Acorn): nothing.  Spent some time trying to learn what I had done wrong, pushing buttons here and there, testing....  After paying an electrician to check things out, I finally wrote the company.  The company offered me a 30% refund (if the defect did not bother me much!) and finally admitted that the bar simply did not support Amazon.  No reason why given - but the fact apparently was well known before I wrote.  I was given a pre-paid return label and a refund (had to buy a box for the equipment, since had thrown away the original; know better now) and got a full refund.  Of course, I have spent about twice what the thing cost and lost several hours of my time.  Bought a Vizio 28 2.1; installed it in about 10 minutes; it works fine - on all.",931
16,DeKovin H.,I like it because it is perfect size to fit media ...,0,2018-07-30,4.0,"I like it because it is perfect size to fit media center in my bedroom. Sound is way better than TV speakers and that I can stream music from my Iphone. I wish that volume could be controlled by my Direct remote, hate having a thousand remotes. Overall I'm happy with it. Went on the site to try to register for extra warranty but got some error and it would not go through.",374
17,Amazon Customer,Dead sound bar,0,2018-07-27,1.0,"3 months after purchase, it died.",33
18,SB New Jersey,Very satisfied with unit and delivery and very easy setup,0,2018-07-26,5.0,"Very satisfied with unit and delivery and very easy setup. I had a problem hearing clearly before and now it is crystal clear.
I also noticed that a question was asked if they can still turn up volume on remote in addition and you CAN.",235
19,W. Moore,Oh question. My opinion is hardly a headline,0,2018-07-25,4.0,"Direct connected  by the optics leads to a Samsung series 8 TV.  It does seem to offer some degree of clarity to voices and some depth to music.
 I do lament  having to use the TT remote for all volume changes.",210
20,briana,Not the best.,0,2018-07-24,3.0,Ok sound for the price. Not as loud as I’d want.,48
21,atmoschem,Stylish and the sound is good!,0,2018-07-24,5.0,"After three month of use, I'm very pleased with the soundbar.
I owned few soundbars. it can easily compete with those big brand names. The sound is punchy and loud for being only 25 inch. I have a 55 TV so this soundbar looks pretty small but it's got a variety of inputs such as bluetooth, optical cable, as expected. I think the physical look of it is great too with minimal branding! it also has the side buttons just in case to lose the remote for some reason. The only thing needs to delete is the Indicator light in the middle. When watching the TV, I couldn't help but to keep looking at the blue dot...",610
22,Amazon Customer,JUST BAD,0,2018-07-23,1.0,Absolute worst sound I've ever heard! Sounds like crumpling paper together!,75
23,Michael Albright ,Great buy!,0,2018-07-23,4.0,"What a great buy, I own 2 other sound bars that are high end and I have to say this unit is right up there with them. I purchased an inexpensive projector and that’s what I’m using this sound bar with. The only thing that would be better is if it had a little more bass to it but other then that definitely worth the money and then some.",337
24,James C.,Improvement over TV speakers,0,2018-07-22,3.0,"Good sound bar for the price. Definite improvement over weak TV speakers. Currently there are no remote codes so it can't be used with universal remote (ugh one more remote to track). Noticed that Verizon Fios remote (mainly up/down arrows buttons and channel up/down buttons) repeats last input from soundbar remote. This gets annoying when scrolling/surfing channels and volume is constantly changing up/down.
8/7/2018
Update: All buttons on the FIOS cable remote repeat the last soundbar remote function.
After adjusting the volume on the soundbar, I hit the input button (Audio, OPT, BT) for the active input to prevent the cable remote from adjusting the volume. Simple workaround.",686
25,Amazon Customer,Well executed product,0,2018-07-22,5.0,"Relatively compact profile. Good dynamic range for the money. Best personal use is with television - gives reasonable depth and clarity to broadcast content.  Optical connection sound output has a slight delay behind television video output. Not a problem with bluetooth connection.  Handy for streaming audio from mobile devices, with decent quality.",351
26,Chris Matthews,Very disappointed.,0,2018-07-22,2.0,"For a novice, I didn’t know that I had to purchase an optic cord to use with my TV. Isn’t that why people buy these things? And it only works 75% of the time when I use the Amazon Firestick. Very disappointed. I will be exchanging it.
Update: This has been working only 25% of the time with the Firestick & Netflix.",315
27,Monty,Works fine and connection is easy but...,0,2018-07-21,2.0,It works fine and the hook up to Bluetooth is super easy. But I am using it to replace some cheap computer speakers and I don't think the sound is any better.,158
28,D. Williams,Works as intended.  Sound quality is not outstanding.,1,2018-07-21,3.0,"Works as expected.  The sound seems a little thin (not much bass), and it is a pain to have to use two remotes--one for the speakers and one for the TV.  The bluetooth feature works as intended.  I mounted this on top of the TV, which is mounted too high to begin with, so I have to hold the remote at head height or above to work the speakers.  A broader area of response to the remote would have made the unit. but a better position for the speakers would have been under to TV (there already was a cable box mounted below the TV)",532
29,Just a guy,Should be in a landfill  pile of Crap!,1,2018-07-21,1.0,"I was not looking for anything special from this product except for it to work. The remote was dead and would not turn the unit off or on even when pointed directly at the unit. If I have to work that hard for the thing to work, it is not worth my trouble. I have a older Samsung U8000 TV from 2009 with optical audio and the speaker would not recognize the signal. Garbage! I set the TV to external speakers. I also tried the RCA plugs and I got nothing. I cycled through the side buttons and also got nothing. Pure garbage. Save yourself the heartache and frustration and stay away from this product.",602
30,Beth,Don't waste your money,0,2018-07-21,1.0,Had it for 3 months and it barely functions now. It was great at first but now the volume will completely go out for no reason after about 30 minutes of use and the remote is junk. You get what you pay for I suppose,215
31,Thomas Ramage,Good for the price.,0,2018-07-20,4.0,This speaker works well for the price.  It brings trebble out in front of the base so you can here the taking over background noise.  I can't hear the words without it.,168
32,Clawhammer91,A nice starter,0,2018-07-20,4.0,"I was happy to see it came with everything needed except for 2 AAA batteries. My only issue is that the speaker lacks on treble. Great for voice amplification for the tv. I was able to run both the sound bar and my tv speakers at the same time so i can balance my highs, mids and lows together. It gets the job done.",316
33,colby goodman,Very limited. Very basic.,0,2018-07-19,1.0,"Junk. Limited to optical in, BT, or headphone jack. No hdmi. Unit won’t seamlessly pair with Samsung TV and no remote code for Xfinity. Unless you want an overpriced iPhone music speaker, stay away if you’re looking for a tv speaker.",233
34,Karla Painter,Muffled sound.,0,2018-07-19,2.0,I use the sound bar with my television. It has a muffled sound to it... No clarity.,83
35,Amazon Customer,"May not work with Netflix and Amazon Prime (HBO, Starz, etc.)",0,2018-07-18,3.0,"I have a Sony Bravia and it has no way to change the audio output format.  I was depending on the optical connection to the soundbar for enhanced sound quality.  I discovered too late that  Netflix and Amazon Prime Video (and I don't know what else yet) don't work for optical output, on this TV anyway.  So for much of my viewing I am forced to use the standard audio input which is really no better than the tv speakers.  A search online shows this is a common problem and may or may not be solvable for you depending on your TV.  This is NOT a soundbar problem; the soundbar is good quality and sound with optical input is very good.  Just be aware.",652
36,Amazon Customer,I like the sound quality,0,2018-07-18,3.0,"I like the sound quality. But my cable remote 'sometimes' effects the volume of the soundbar. And 'sometimes' the volume control on the device's remote gets a mind of its own, meaning down becomes up. I wish there was a way to link a universal remote to the soundbar or at least a way to completely separate the two.",316
37,Bye Bye Blackbird,"So many problems, it is really annoying.",0,2018-07-17,2.0,"Provides great sound but will randomly go static. So I have to turn everything off then turn them back on. DVD player included. If I leave a movie to play on repeat (sleeping noise and such) immediately on the second repeat, the sound is WAY off, by at least a 4 second delay. Which will not go away unless I turn everything off, DVD player included. Really annoying .",368

43,J.D.,Great value in a small soundbar,0,2018-07-12,5.0,"Great small sound bar for the price. I purchased this sound bar for the 24inch tv in our RV. It is about 3 inches wider than the TV. The element TV sounds like a 70’s transistor radio, you could not hear it over the Air Conditioning. This bar sounds great and has surprisingly good bass for its size and price. It’s nice to be able to play pandora and XM radio as well. I am very satisfied with the purchase and would buy again.",428
44,Hank Ifer,TaoTronics living up to their reputation (actual product dimensions included),0,2018-07-10,5.0,"Great soundbar. Really fills the room with good volume. The soundbar dimensions are approximately 25"" long x 3.25"" deep x 2.7"" tall. That was the part I was most worried about. I use the optical cord and the sound is clear and loud. Would definitely recommend",259
45,J. D. S.,Works Well,0,2018-07-09,4.0,The sound isn't as good as our 20 year old Sony amp with Bose speakers but it works really well for our second TV. No complaints!,129
46,guy a,Great for the money.,0,2018-07-09,5.0,Alittle confused on set up. The direction book is useless ; called the company customer support. They were very polite and walked me through the set up. Sound's wayyyyyyyy better than the stock inset tv speaker. Sound's really amazing for video game's. Great base and mid's. Highly recomend this product... Doesn't support live Youtube audio.,342

Can't figure out what seems to be missing but it just sounds cheap.  In fact my last sound system was cheaper and sounded better.  Won't buy this brand again for anything.
Sunvalley exchanged with another one and it sounds great without problem.  Only thing i don't like is that it turns off when tv is left alone without something playing.  Don't know why they did that but sound is great.",439
50,Dawn M Barber,Nice sound. Instructions consist of a list of components,0,2018-07-08,4.0,Nice sound for a good price. The lack of instructions on how to hook it up frustrating when you are inexperienced. It did turn out to be fairly easy.,149

54,Stanton D. Allaben,Waste of money,0,2018-07-04,1.0,Junk. This product comes with unintelligible directions. I had to call them to figure out how to hook it up.  I bought it to use with Prime movies....it doesn't work with that and  maybe not Netflix and Hulu too.  Waste of money.,229

Glad I met ya!!",0,2018-07-03,5.0,"Ordered from Amazon and arrived in 2 days... worked absolutely wonderfully and enhanced our TV viewing with much better audio than before.  BUT!!  It only lasted 4 days and it quit.  Called the Company's tech support, they tried everything and when they coud not help, they referred me to Amazon to return it.  I spoke to a gentleman who was extremelly nice and helpful.  He had me return it and said the credit would be applied to my account within 3 working days.  I returned it, and went to the site again and ordered it, and the new one arrived and it is working perfectly.. wished we had ordered this several years ago when the TV was new... well worth the price and the Tech support could not be any better.

65,Paul P,"Nice sound from a 25"" soundbar",0,2018-07-02,5.0,"This soundbar has pretty rich sound fot its size. I use it in a 12x16 bedroom and it certainly fills that space. It's attached to a 50 inch Samsung Series 6 smart TV, which I found to have less than stellar sound, so got this soundbar. Didn't  think a bigger one was necessary for the space I have. I use both Bluetooth and optical connections. Both work well, but I can use my existing remote for volume changes with the Bluetooth, so I use that most. I don't hear a lot of difference berween the two. This is absolutely an improvement over the TV speakers of course, with deeper bass and overall depth of sound that I was a bit surprised by.  I think this TaoTronic unit is just fine for me, in this sized space, so I do recommend  it for that. It is sleek looking and fits perfectly under my screen, so I barely know it's there, except for the great sound! Haven't tried it in a larger setting, so someone else will have to comment on that.",943

75,Paul,Not worth it,0,2018-06-24,1.0,First you do need to use their remote if you use the optical cable (really another remote guys!). If you use the 3.5 you’re not supposed to need it. All mine did was buzz annoyingly. Don’t buy this. It’s not worth it. There are better ones out there for about the same money.,275

The quality is good but the base is okay. Over all I recommend this product",224
77,Nick,Great value for the price point!,18,2018-06-23,5.0," Overall, very pleased with this product.  I purchased this product to enhance the sound of my TV for music, movies, shows, and video games.  Extremely satisfied so far, I have tried many other sound bars in the past and they have been underwhelming in comparison.
Packaging was solid and product was untarnished upon delivery.
Extremely fast setup, was able to pair my phone and laptop within 2 minutes of taking it out of the box to initially test the sound quality.  Trebles and mids are very crisp.  For a soundbar, the bass is present and delivers good sound.  However, I also have a few subs hooked up to my TV so I am not as concerned about this product having ground-shaking bass.  As such, if you are expecting strong stand-alone bass, I would suggest supplementing this product with one or more subwoofers depending on the size of your room.  Finally, unlike other soundbars I have used in the past, the sound does not get distorted when increasing the volume.  Pleasantly surprised at this ---- definitely a testament to the internal acoustics.
Didn't have any trouble connecting this soundbar to my phone via Bluetooth and to my TV via the included optical cable.  Being able to shift between these modes is helpful when deciding whether to keep connected to the TV or just using it on its own.  The transition between modes is very fast as well, which is convenient.
There is a full set of controls on the side of the soundbar (just in case you misplace the remote) which is definitely a plus.  The remote is lightweight, easy to use, and met my expectations.
All-in-all, I really like this soundbar!  Very good value, I will be sure keep this review up-to-date should my expectations change in either direction.",1725
78,R. Stockton,Terrific value,0,2018-06-23,4.0,"The feel and heft of this product is excellent. Very solid, very functional. For its intended purpose, it woeks well, simple bluetooth pairing and use. We have wall speakers, and it equals or surpasses those. The hard part is trting to compare to other products because this is my only one. Would the Bose small bar sound better? Three times as good, since it costs that much more? Probably not. For all the features, performance, and cost, I am thrilled with this one.",469
79,BJG,Transfer of control unintentinally to my tv remote,0,2018-06-22,4.0,"Sound is OK but my tv remote will change the volume anytime I change the station ---- not good.

92,Krams,Really great sound and great looking,3,2018-06-15,5.0," UPDATE: This is still a great sound bar. the update is regarding the mounting screw/plastic anchor provided. The anchors are not that great and you will need a working anchor to mount this in a drywall.
This is a really nice sound bar. Small enough to be a large blue tooth speaker but yet will fit under a TV for a great sound either way. Nice deep bass for its size. Clear and loud. Easy connections to my phone and mac. Connects to other devices as well easily. The controls are discretely placed. Keeps little hands from messing around with the setup when placed appropriately. The added remote control allows this to be mounted so that the controls are hidden completely. It has mounting hooks on the back fro wall mounting. and comes with screws and drywall plastic anchors to get the job done - the measuring sheet in the box allows for easy drilling and mounting the screws right the first time on your wall. The speaker then can be attached to the screws simply by sliding it in. The power port is set inside at a depth so that the power plug does not cause any issues when mounted on the wall.
The only downside that I saw was the glossy surface grabs on to finger prints like crazy but again it makes it look good when it is visible and is easy enough to cleanup. Typical glossy surface problem. However when mounted that goes away.
The sound fills a very large room comfortably and no vibrations when the volume is maxed out.

Well at least for me (suburb of Chicago) this doesn't work with an aerial broadcast.  Not sure why.  It works with Netflix and other streaming, so I can watch movies and other shows through non-aerial broadcast, so I'll be keeping it.  But you should know before you buy it (the TV I'm trying to pair the sound bar with was a 42in Samsung 2017 model from Amazon).
Update: 07/17/18 - I had mentioned in my review that the soundbar did not work with non-arial broadcast.  The company contacted be, I did not have to contact them, they tried to help and assist me in fixing the problem.  Unfortunately, the soundbar does not work with my aerial broadcast, but I was so happy with my customer service and the 50% discount that they provided me with that I upgraded the rating.  The soundbar works with non-aerial broadcast and I continue to use and I would say their customer service is probably some of the most responsive I've found on Amazon.",1132

Fortunately, the width of the screw mount holes were wide enough to allow me to drill some screws directly to my wall studs. In terms of functionality, the Bluetooth works as expected to connect my iPod to it without issues. Otherwise, I keep the soundbar directly connected to my TV via the included optical cable provided with this package. The width of the sound bar (25 inches) works well, as the TV in my gym is also small. The sound is decent enough to not complain about (especially for the price) and includes the expected inputs such as a 3.5mm jack, which allows me to input non-Bluetooth devices.

The instructions were given in several languages with English taking up three of the folded pages with one of them a  small diagram of the control buttons on the front of the unit. Being in my seventies, I needed a magnifying glass to make out the letters identifying the buttons. I then had to find the legend which described the letters functions. Aside from additional notes, there was nothing to explain the various cord plugs and their particular use and where they should plug into the back of the TV. It was the typical ambiguous sheet I'd seen before, and I knew I would spend many minutes deciphering the instructions. Eventually i did and felt the unit was properly plugged in. I set up the TV for Sound from other  Sources, Checked the power cord that was plugged-in. Then I turned on the unit. Nothing. Rechecked every thing . Again, nothing. So I checked Amazon for Customer Services. Yeah I could call but it had to be to a company that would charge me money for a couple of minutes conversation. B.S. What a racket. All too eager to sell products, But not to follow up with helpful explanations. Last time for this Senior Citizen to get hoodwinked into this scam or buy from Amazon again.",1331

134,Maximilian Rockefeller,Great small sound bar for casual use,10,2018-05-23,5.0,"What we have here is a budget friendly sound bar that would be great for use as audio soeakers for a PC, a small television, or an office.
Background: I'm an avid listener of Rap/Hip-hop, Metal, Classical, the whole spectrum of electronic music, and classic/hard rock - so my taste and audio needs stretch pretty widely from base heavy, hard driving beats to clean crisp detail clarity.
This little soundbar has enough 'umph' to listen to most music adequately so long as you don't push the volume maximum.  After receiving this I put it through the ringer of songs I know will push the envelope for audio clarity and definition, base depth, and distortion. I found about half the time much of the performance depended on the audio quality of the sound file and the other half the actual speakers.
When compared to my $500 Vizio sound bar w/separate base speakera obviously there's no comparison. So keep an open mind with your expectations.
Based on the performace and size I would aay this would work great for a office PC for listening to low to moderate volume music, or for pc games where deep base isn't a priority, as well as a small TV in a kids room or guest bedroom.
For what it cost - you'll be hard pressed to find a better value. I've used enough TaoTronics products by now that their quality meets my expectations for budget consumer electronics with a number of items lasting years at this point.

I have purchased their products in the past and have never been disappointed so I decided to order this one.
We have a very nice soundbar with subwoofer and speakers in our living room.  While that type of setup is fine for the living room, I didn't want all the extra components in my bedroom.
Truthfully I was concerned about how the sound quality was going to be because of it only being inches. Just didn't think it would be possible to get high quality sound out of a soundbar this small, but I now know this is possible.
One of things I've noticed is how well Taotronics packages their products, it is very obvious that they are proud of their products, and the have every reason to be!

Decided to return 5 minutes after set up. Couldn't even get tv audio to play through the speaker but the entire time the unit was on the speaker made an obnoxious, very noticeable, squealing sound.",534
162,Maggie,"I needed better instructions, but it works and sounds good.",13,2018-05-01,3.0,"I thought this sound bar was defective and DOA, but thank goodness I found my solution in these reviews.
I panicked thinking this would be an immediate return.  Returns are not ever “hassle free,” no matter how generous a return policy or warranty may be.  After much struggle and much digging for info in this forum, I discovered what I needed to do to finally make it work.  I don’t usually work with any electronic components, and I know very, very little about device installation.  I was disappointed to find no detailed instructions included for set up.  It may have one line for Bluetooth pairing, but nothing beyond that.  I have a fairly new Samsung smart tv that had been a little buggy with the Netflix app, so I wasn’t sure if it was the bar or my tv with the problem.  I knew to select the audio output/optical in my sound settings, but I had to sift through comments on this Amazon board to find out that I needed to access the Expert Sound Settings and select PCM for the Digital Output Audio Format to get the bar to work.  Now that the tv is communicating with the bar, the bar fills the room with sound.  It is a huge improvement to the tv’s factory speakers.
This was one of the lowest cost alternatives I could use to boost my tv’s sound, so I wasn’t expecting all (or any) the bells and whistles.  It does sound very full and clear now that it’s all connected.  Truly, that’s all I really wanted from this bar.  It is a little off-putting that the sound bar manufacturer could not include an extra 2 tiny lines of clear instructions for those of us who are a little less tech savvy.
Having to use the remote that came with it to adjust sound is a bit clumsy.  Who really wants to rely on yet another remote?  The full and clear sound and low price were the factors that made me decide to keep this item and not return it.",1842

UPDATE: The company read my review and they are serious about customer support. They sent me a newer model with better bass and somewhat better stereo sound. I would still recommend something with surround instead, but I can't complain about their willingness to do whatever it takes to make the customer happy.",462
166,Luke,Sounds great,0,2018-04-26,5.0,This is a great soundbar.  Way better than my tv speakers.  It is small enough to sit on my tv stand but delivers big sound.  Setup was super easy.  One power cord and one audio cable and it was working.,203

168,JCG,Good affordable soundbar,0,2018-04-22,5.0,"I love this soundbar - it's sleek and small. My Visio TV was not loud enough and the sound wasn't reaching the couch - the soundbar changed that. I was able to just put the soundbar under the TV, but I liked that there was a mounting option and that they had a paper strip to help you identify where the fasteners in the wall need to be to mount it. Sound is good, but I'm not an audiophile - just someone who loves their Netflix!",430

170,Mark G,Great sound quality,4,2018-04-19,5.0,"We have a Sharp LC-32LB150U. The speakers just don’t cut it. I was looking for a sound bar that didn’t cost a lot and wasn’t big, since the TV is on a dresser in our bedroom. I was afraid that I wouldn’t find a quality sound bar at a low price. This unit is perfect for the bedroom. I was surprised and impressed with the sound quality. It is so much better than the TV speakers.
It can be connected by a 3.5mm audio cable, an optical cable, RCA cable, and through Bluetooth. I use the optical cable to connect the TV and I connect my Amazon Alexa Show with Bluetooth to the sound bar to stream music. Optical and RCA cables were included in the box.
There are two mounting holes on the back of the unit and it comes with two wall anchors and screws. There are rubber feet if you don’t wall mount it. I was surprised at how light the sound bar is.
If you’re looking for something for a large media room, this will likely disappoint, since it isn’t big on bass for a larger room, but for a bedroom, this unit fits the bill perfectly.",1032

173, AR,Great cheap soundbar - perfect for upgrading your smaller Echo,2,2018-04-18,5.0,"For my use its perfect.  I wanted a nice soundbar to pair with my Echo.  This fit the bill perfectly.
I used the Bluetooth briefly and it works OK.  Overall I leave it connected through Alexa.  It plays loud and clear.  Especially coming from the Echo's little speaker the quality boost feels incredible.  Overall I like the bar's design and the remote's responsiveness.
Pros:
Loud
Reliable, clean aux: no static
Supports Bluetooth and optical (included)
Great designed remote.
Two very minor cons in my opinion:
1) The power cable should be longer, and I personally don't like adapters built into the end.
2) When power is plugged in, you still need to turn it on from the remote.  I would much rather see it turn on automatically.
Overall this is an excellent soundbar at a good price.  Highly recommended.",808
174,Jimmy G,A great sound bar indeed,2,2018-04-17,5.0,"I have been wondering about buying a sound bar for some time. The question has been whether to buy a wired or wireless one. Then, it occurred to me why not getting a sound bar with both options. I decided to buy the Taotronics. It is a 25” Sound Bar. I used it in our bedroom and our living room. The set up was pretty easy. It does not require much-added equipment such as a receiver. It is sufficient by itself. The convenience of it is the ability to use it with the television, the iPad, the Tablet, and my phone.
Furthermore, I am a professional speaker. I often play music from my computer to get the crowd excited in hotel ballrooms, or university classroom. I cannot always rely on the speakers of the venue. I tried this speaker in a vast hall and, I liked the performance. It was not the best but okay for the 45 seconds I needed. The bass is good but not the type you would enjoy some good oldies music in a closed environment. Of course, in my living room, I have a subwoofer to support my other speakers. The wired set up is easy and offers some options such as optical connections.
The speaker comes with a 3.5 mm to RCA cable, optical cable, a power cord, and a remote control.",1192

176,Shawn Wallace,Disappointing Bluetooth Audio,7,2018-04-16,1.0,"I was so excited to receive this product, especially with all of the positive reviews I read (most of which are probably paid reviews).  The sound bar looks very nice and is very easy to set up. My issue with this bar starts with the Bluetooth connection. I bought this so I could always have music playing from my phone via Bluetooth, however, the audio is HORRIBLE when connected through Bluetooth. I’ve tried 3 different devices and got the same outcome. The highs are extremely distorted and the bass is so weak. NOW, when connected through the aux cable, the sound is pretty good. The bass is not nearly loud enough and does throw off the overall balance, but the high and mids are decent. Instead of returning, I just use an old device and keep it connected through the aux cable. I would NOT recommend this product, especially with all of the fake “verified” reviews. This is why it deserves 1 star.",906

The buttons are located on the side so they can be accessed even when the soundbar is mounted on the wall but it also comes with a remote.,369
179,Paul C. Nicholson,"Lots of features, alas, the sound will disappoint",9,2018-04-11,2.0,"I purchased a number of Tao Tronics products (mainly bluetooth devices), and have been satisfied.  So I bought the new ""improved"" TaoTronic sound bar expecting it to conform with the positive reviews (they must have recruited their close friends to write reviews).  The product is o.k. in most respects, but it has one fatal flaw. It is almost devoid of base.  The sound is only maginally better than the TV's lousy internal speakers.
It's a shame, because it has some nice features.  For example it has lots of input options including optical, bluetooth  and 3.5mm line in, but alas, the lack of base results in practically .no improvement in TV sound.",653

181,Sharky,Superior Base Soundbar,8,2018-04-09,5.0,"After a few days of testing, here are my findings:
Pros:
- Great sound quality.
- Great exterior finish and fits well with my setup. Slim and reduced footprint works for me.
- Digital Audio cable is included.
Neutral:
- No auto-off. This is might be a pro for some and a con for others. Since the product has no auto-on feature, you will have to power it up every time you need it. Since you can leave the item on all the time, this can work for some. Be aware that this has a rating of  1.0A so that is a consideration. Also, in the end, leaving any gadget on for an indefinite period creates faster wear.
- Other input modes are not included, so be sure to read through the available features before purchasing. I used the Digital Audio connector, and have no need for others.
Con:
- Power cord is not as long as I had hoped, so I personally had to adjust my connectors to accommodate.",887

I like the fact that this sound bar can be connected with bluetooth. I also like the fact that this soundbar looks so cute.
Although this doesn't come with a woofer. This sound bar is comparable to the expensive sound bar and woofer attached to my living room television set.",369
184,Glenn Mendonca,Compact - Beautiful - Pleasant,56,2018-04-04,5.0," This soundbar is a great example of quality product, tightly bundled and aesthetic looking all in one package. Everyone's perception of sound / music is very different. So device tastes for soundbars, headphones vary a lot. Over the years I have become quite picky with the audio equipment I own - and I am glad I decided to try this soundbar. It checks all the boxes for sound quality, design for me.
Packaging
The product comes neatly bundled in one small packing. The soundbar along with the power supply, audio cables and a remote. Would be nice to include the batteries for the remote as well, but that's a big deal. It also comes with wall mounting screws and a label for it. Very neat and thoughtful and not a lot of waste material in the packaging as well.
Device Look and Feel
It is a shiny little device which sits very nicely on my TV stand in the living room. Takes up very little space. There is a small LED inside the front grill which is a nice visual cue of when the remote is conversing with the soundbar. The logo placement is very neat and isn't loud atall.
Sound Quality
On full volume the device is very loud and can be heard throughout my house. Even at the loudest setting there is no distortion at all. I compared it against my Samsung soundbar and this one is a couple of notches better in terms of sound quality.
Overall
I would surely recommend this product to any anyone looking to invest in a soundbar and is on a budget. This doesn't fail to impress.",1481

186,jimb0,"BOOMING sound, easy setup w/ Bluetooth for mobile devices!",6,2018-04-01,5.0,"Purchased this item for my apartment and so far it's working GREAT. Setup was extremely easy, I wouldn't recommend adding on the EXPERT SETUP, ask a friend or someone if you really need help. I connected this to the TV w/ the RCA to 3.5mm. The sound on this is booming and sounds so much better than with just tv speakers. Connecting to my phone via bluetooth was simple and no issues as well, use this every so often mainly when I'm cooking. Tested sound from lowest to highest and it's a huge range, which was not expected. Set phone volume to lowest and soundbar to lowest and turned soundbar volume to highest and it was extremely loud, didn't want to turn up phone volume as it was already too loud. It also came with screws/mount kit if you wanted to mount, but I just have it sitting on my TV stand for now. So far this is great and I definitely recommend, will be great for when guests are over.",903
187,Narayan Iyer,Value for money - sound bar,17,2018-04-01,5.0,"Nice mountable design with tactile controls on one side of bar, i also own a previous bluetooth soundbar(34 inch - TT-SK15) where in the controls are at the center so this is a nice improvement,audio quality is stellar, loud bass, sound and easy to operate with remote and sounds excellent with TV with optical cable for more crispier sound.
High-sensitivity IR remote control displays the different modes by means of differently colored LED lights, i also plugin using my 3.5mm audiojack(not included) when i use it in my office room and use it as a stereo speaker which plays very well. Bluetooth range is standard and covers a long distance across rooms into my kitchen and it remembers multiple devices which is a nice addition - perfect value for money for the 18 month TT guarantee
its a perfect addition for my studio room, i highly recommend it for the price point.",873
188,AI509,Quailty product for the price,1,2018-03-30,4.0,"I got this for my kids playroom. Its great and really does the trick, it doesn't stick out, I put it behind the tv.
I have it wired in bc my TV isnt Bluetooth, so its nice your TV doesn't have to be the newest model for this to work on.
Puts out the sound so much better than the normal tv speakers. It makes you wonder why I waited so long to get a soundbar!
All in all, its a good product. Is it the best? No, but its pretty close for what this cost. If your looking for one for maybe a den or secondary tv i say you will be satisfied with it. The user manual was pretty easy to read even though most people wont need it.",623
189,Dalek Caan,Very sleek looking,4,2018-03-27,5.0,"Has great sound. It can be turned down pretty low, and go pretty loud while still sounding good. Very easy to setup and use. Definitely sounds better than my TVs speakers, way easier to hear what people on TV are saying without having to turn it up really loud.
I love that it has all the buttons hidden on the side so I can still use it if I can't find the remote.
The speaker was packed very well in its box and arrived in perfect working condition.",451
190,12milluz,Stylish and functional!,51,2018-03-26,5.0,"I have a fairly inexpensive LCD TV that has decent audio, but nothing fantastic. I wanted to add a sound bar for a couple reasons. One, I assumed it would sound better, but also because I wanted to have a Bluetooth speaker for my phone when I'm cleaning and doing other stuff around my apartment. This satisfies both needs for me. Audio quality is very good; definitely a step above the internal speakers in my TV. The Bluetooth function works great too. Good range all around my apartment and it gets more than loud enough.
My only complaint about these sound bars are how they sit in front of your TV. This is no fault of this model itself, but I always think it looks a bit goofy in front of my TV because my TV's base extends a fair distance out. This leaves it looking less than seemless unless you have a mounting scheme in mind or your TV has a small base. Again, that's not really an issue with this sound bar, but it is something to think about when adding a sound bar to your setup.
All in all, I'd recommend this. These things can be super expensive, and this one is pretty good the price. It's nice to have multiple inputs, even though my main use is just using the optical in for the TV and Bluetooth for my phone. I also like that there are hard buttons on the side of the unit, even though I almost exclusively use the remote.",1341
191,Timber12,Loud soundbar!!,7,2018-03-26,5.0,"Bought this for my TCL P Series TV.  Great 4K HDR TV but only decent sound so a soundbar was a must!
So far I love it!  Sound is loud and crisp!! I'm using Optical cables as I don't like to switch between inputs and this does the trick really well.  Just disable the speakers and boom your good to go!
Lack of  HDMI might scare some but if you ask me it's better.  It has Bluetooth which connected to my phone easily and connectivity was solid from almost 10 meters away. Will be using this during parties to play sound throughout the room.
Overall great soundbar.. I don't know how the $200 ones sound compared to this.. but I can't imagine it being worth it unless you're in a sound studio or something.",705

Comes with red/white audio to 1/8th"" jack cable, optical cable, remote (no batteries included), AC adaptor (I wish it were a bit longer), quick instruction manual, and two screws with wall anchors to mount it (you'd want to test if these anchors would hold up the weight).

194,BASH Colorado,Solid SoundBar with excellent sound,20,2018-03-23,5.0,"I know it's a small thing but I'm always impressed by this company's packaging. Quality boxes, with individually wrapped items and protective foam. Yea...it's not a big deal but that first impression when opening a box demonstrates that they care about the details.
Ok...enough babbling about the box - what about the device?
It's amazing the sound quality that can be packed into these sound bars. I have a Bose AV system in the basement and it's a monster. This soundbar is right up there with it for my smaller TV upstairs...and it's all-in-one. As an added bonus, you can also directly stream to it as another set of speakers from any BT device.
Finally - along the same lines as the box - this may not seem like much but the build quality is excellent. Clean lines, solid remote and quality accessories. Would definitely consider other TaoTronics devices based on how they did with this soundbar.",901

It works great with my TV and it is nice that it can be connected with an optical cable. Makes it great for watching movies.
